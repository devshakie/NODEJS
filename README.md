# Node.js CRUD API with Xata Database  
### Overview
This repository contains various Node.js tasks, including the implementation of a CRUD API connected to the **Xata** database. It demonstrates how to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records from a database using Node.js and Xata.
   
This project uses a Xata database to store and manage data for the CRUD API operations. Below is a screenshot of the database structure and the table where the data is stored.
